# REQUIREMENTS  

  1. Create yet another design for a web app that you would want to useâ€¦ this should go quickly for us now!  

  2. Create a web app that shows some simple server-side scripting, perhaps two buttons or forms where one calls a function on the server that writes something to a file and another that retrieves that text  

  3. Go find some plugin, module, or whatever your server-side environment uses to enhance its framework and create a website that shows off that module (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that module?).  

  4. Remember to submit a link to a repo or a copy of your code to Moodle!
