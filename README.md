# assignment05 - RETURN TO DOGESPLORER  
cs290 Winter 2024 assignment 05  


# REQUIREMENTS  

  1. Create yet another design for a web app that you would want to useâ€¦ this should go quickly for us now!  

  2. Create a web app that shows some simple server-side scripting, perhaps two buttons or forms where one calls a function on the server that writes something to a file and another that retrieves that text  

  3. Go find some plugin, module, or whatever your server-side environment uses to enhance its framework and create a website that shows off that module (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that module?).  

  4. Remember to submit a link to a repo or a copy of your code to Moodle!  


# DESIGN  

I feel more comfortable making a new Dogesplorer site with the tools I have been shown over the 
past few weeks. I am still not 100% sure how I might access the blockchain information, but I know 
I could set up a simple web API that uses the information from dogechain.info. I plan on using internet 
resources, most notably w3schools, geeksforgeeks, and chatGPT. I will make better comments, and plan to 
streamline styling.  

another resource I must use is the "Web API" one on dogechain.info

* mobile functionality in terms of display and usability - PRIORITIZE  
* Create main page  
* search bar at top  
* collapsible menu to the left   
* dynamic page creation upon search - backburner
* add a news page  
* add a sitemap  
* add breadcrumbs (real ones this time?)  
* use GET and POST  
* add doge price GRAPH FUNCTION on it's own page first? - or delegate to API?  




# GET/POST NOTES

* GET is insecure and has a character limit. Never use GET for sensitive info  
* POST is secure and is unlimited in terms of length.  
* Use inside a python script. Python script runs the page by communicating with the server  
* there is really only one page that will be fetched. What changes is the information being transmitted.  
* make Dogesplorer the number 1 Doge Explorer on the 'net!
